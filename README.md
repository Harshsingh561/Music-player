# Music-player
This is a music player gui created by me this is a fun project so code will not look that much professional.

                  HOW TO USE
              When the screen pop ups there will be many 
              songs which is preinstalled when you are going to 
              download this code.
              
              On right side of the screen there will be list of songs
              you can double click on anyone of them to play the song.
              If you want to delete or add a song you can directly add it
              to the My_music folder.
              
              On your top right side there is a sleep button what it does is whenever you click on it
              it make the screen transparent and as you click on it the screen becomes more transparent.
              You can make the screen opaque by just clicking on that sleep button.
              
              On your top left side there is a play music option from there you can play any music from your 
              computer. Note => The music will not be added permantely.
              
              You can rewind music by clicking on rewind button or by double clicking on the text which shows which song is playing.
              
              To mute or unmute the song you can click on the sound Button.
              
              Required module:
              Type this command in your terminal => pip install pygame
